  	<h1>Mofadesewa Atanda: More Details</h1>
  		<p>On the home page, I mentioned that one of my main interests is skincare! I will talk more about that on this page.</p>
  		
  	<h2>SKINCARE</h2>
  	<p>Skincare is the act of taking care of one's skin. I take skincare seriously because I have acne prone skin and acne can make my skin irritated and inflamed. Some of my favorite skincare products are pictured below.</p>
  	<h2>Skincare Routines</h2>
  	<p>Skincare can sometimes be intimidating but it really is just about taking care of your skin. Below is a quick morning skincare routine for beginners.</p>
  	<p>I currently run an Instagram account @skincarewithsewa which focuses on giving people accurate information on skincare, and tips on how to go about skincare. Watch the video below for a glimpse into the kind of content I post on that page. </p>
